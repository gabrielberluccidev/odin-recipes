<h2>Recipe Description</h2>
<p>
  No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the
  classic method.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Spaghetti: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one
    pound of uncooked spaghetti.
  </li>
  <li>Oil: You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil.</li>
  <li>Garlic: Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor.</li>
  <li>
    Seasonings: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed
    red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano
    cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.
  </li>
</ul>
