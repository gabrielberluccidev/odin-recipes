<p>
  No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the
  classic method.

    Spaghetti: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one
    pound of uncooked spaghetti.

    Seasonings: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed
    red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley.
  </li>

    cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.
  </li>
</ul>
